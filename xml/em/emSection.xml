    <!-- (will) include the 16 towers, grid, and ACD
         Each "tower" has a tracker, a calorimeter, and a mechanical
         piece inbetween. (what about electronics?)
         Each tracker consists of trays
         Each tray has 1 (iff top or bottom) or 2 layers of silicon
         and most trays also have a converter layer (can be of
         two possible thicknesses. -->
    <!-- Use conventions as laid out in Steve Ritz's memo.  Z is
    up (perp. to cal. layers and tracker trays).  An "x-strip"
    is one that measures the x-coordinate of the hit, hence its
    length is parallel to the y-axis.  An "x-log", on the other
    hand, has its long axis parallel to the x-axis (but there 
    is some consistency here: logs make their most precise 
    measurement in the direction parallel to their length.) 
    
    Cal layer numbers increase from the front (largest Z value,
    which is 0 for the Cal) to the back (smallest Z).  Layer 0 
    has x-logs;  layer 7, the last layer, has y-logs.  
    
    Tracker trays and layers are numbered from back to front,
    i.e. increase with increasing Z.  All strips associated
    with a tray (i.e., front side and back side, if the tray 
    is one that has both) have the same orientation.  Even-numbered
    trays have Y-strips and odd-numbered trays have X-strips.

     entities are properly dealt with, probably won't be able to use
