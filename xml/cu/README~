This directory contains xml files used in CU simulation. It has been tested 
with GlastRelease v2r0.

In order for it to work, following the steps below:

1. copy CarbonStd.* to ../../../Recon/v2r7p3/PEGS4
2. add following to your job option file:
GlastDetSvc.xmlfile="$(XMLGEODBSROOT)/xml/cu/cuSegVols.xml";

G4Generator codes have to be hacked to produce magnetic field. These 
non-standard codes are not in CVS. If required, please contact Xin Chen xchen@slac.stanford.edu for the codes.

Note dump and magnetic field are roughly 20 meters away from CU. So you need to move around in event display to see them.
