This directory contains xml files used in CU simulation. It has been tested 
with GlastRelease v2r0.

In order for it to work, following the steps below:

1. copy CarbonStd.*, IronStd.* to ../../../Recon/v2r7p3/PEGS4
2. add following to your job option file:

GlastDetSvc.xmlfile="$(XMLGEODBSXMLPATH)/cu/cuSegVols.xml";
GlastDetSvc.topVolume = "world";

G4GeometrySvc.magneticFieldVolumn = "cuFieldBox";
//unit is tesla
G4GeometrySvc.magneticFieldX = 1.0;
G4GeometrySvc.magneticFieldY = 0.;
G4GeometrySvc.magneticFieldZ = 0.;
