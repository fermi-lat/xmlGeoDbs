<!-- side tile stuff -->
  <prim name="sideTileHeight0" value="331">Height of top row 
of side tiles.  Really should be 360, but we're forgoing overlap
   and slant of top tiles for now</prim>

  <prim name="sideTileTransCentral" value="322.0">Transverse 
 dimension of central side tiles (column 2)
  (Nov 1, 2002 remarks:  use to be computed as 308.0. Never has
  been supplied as fundamental constant.  New computation for ACD side
  length is ACDSidesGap + tileThickness - dovetailGap = 1690. Subtracting
  lengths of other tiles and of horiz. gaps ==> 322)
</prim>


  <prim name="totalSideAvail" value="52.0">Total amount of
space available for side section of ACD, including both tiles and
support structure. (1 Nov 2002 remarks: is this number still current?  
In any case it's not used anywhere)</prim>

<!-- support dimensions -->
<prim name="ACDSideCoreThickness" value="25.4">Thickness of side support
structure for ACD, not including face sheets.  As of Oct., 2002</prim>
<prim name="ACDTopCoreThickness" value="50.8">Thickness of top support
structure for ACD, not including face sheets.  As of Oct., 2002</prim>

  <prim name="PMTFiberGap" value="41.6">Minimum distance between
  outer edge of side support structure and inner edge of innermost
  side tile.  Side ribbons (as well as PMT fibers) may go in this gap</prim>

  <prim name="topTileSupportStandoff" value="25.4" >Minimum distance
  between lowest top tiles and top of ACD support.  Ribbons are placed
  within this gap.</prim>

 top tile, as of Oct. 2002</prim>
  <prim name="ribbonOverlap" value="15.0">Amount X ribbon segment overshoots
     tile edge of tile it's under</prim>

 <!-- old number with new name (was "topStandoff"  
    No guarantee it's correct. -->
  <prim name="TKRACDSupportGap" value="10.0"> distance between bottom of
ACD support and top of TKR.  **NOTE** increased from 10.0 to 45.0
to keep ACD supports from colliding with grid (4 nov 2002)
30 April 2003: see what happens when I change it back to 10.0
</prim>

<!-- following is probably obsolete -->
  <prim name="tapeTopExt" value="15.0">Distance tape should extend

<!-- maybe these as well, as of Oct, 2002 reworking -->

side_standoff is another name for side_tile_standoff, the distance
between the side of the tracker and the ACD tiles.  [Deprecated.  ]</prim>
  <prim name="ACDSideSupToTile" value = "35.75"> Distance from inside edge of
side support structure to inside edge of side tiles.  This is temporary, to
be replaced probably with a derived ACD constant which is the sum of the
support thickness and gap between support and side tile.</prim>
  <prim name="totalTopAvail" value="91.9">This is the total amount of space
    available to top section of the ACD, includes tiles and support structure
(Heather).</prim>
