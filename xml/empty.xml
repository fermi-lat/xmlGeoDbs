    This is a placeholder.  If the description of an instrument requires
    extra materials
    extra primary constants
    extra derived constants

    the top-level file for that instrument should define the relevant
    alias  (extraMaterials, extraPrim  or extraDerived) to point to
    a file with the needed content rather than to this all-comment file
