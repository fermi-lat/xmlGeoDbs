    <!-- (will) include the 16 towers, grid, and ACD
         Each "tower" has a tracker, a calorimeter, and a mechanical
         piece inbetween. (what about electronics?)
         Each tracker consists of trays
         Each tray has 1 (iff top or bottom) or 2 layers of silicon
         and most trays also have a converter layer (can be of
         two possible thicknesses. -->
    <!-- Use conventions as laid out in Steve Ritz's memo.  Z is
    up (perp. to cal. layers and tracker trays).  An "x-strip"
    is one that measures the x-coordinate of the hit, hence its
    length is parallel to the y-axis.  An "x-log", on the other
    hand, has its long axis parallel to the x-axis (but there 
    is some consistency here: logs make their most precise 
    measurement in the direction parallel to their length.) 
    
    Cal layer numbers increase from the front (largest Z value,
    which is 0 for the Cal) to the back (smallest Z).  Layer 0 
    has x-logs;  layer 7, the last layer, has y-logs.  
    
    Tracker trays and layers are numbered from back to front,
    i.e. increase with increasing Z.  All strips associated
    with a tray (i.e., front side and back side, if the tray 
    is one that has both) have the same orientation.  Even-numbered
    trays have Y-strips and odd-numbered trays have X-strips.

    The two volumes below require some explanation. LATenv is the usual envelope
    containing the LAT. It is now used to construct the composition called
    LATInner, which is exactly what the LAT used to be.
    
    LATShiftedEnv is a new envelope that contains LATInner. The purpose of this
    envelope is to allow for a vertical displacement of the *entire* LAT, by an
    amount globalOffset_dz. This is used to test the translational invariance of
    the Gleam code
