The '1Tower' and '2Tower' files correspond to the grid positions 
we were supposed to have for one and two towers. However, the 
positions have changed. To maintain backwards compatibility 
(we have generated MC with these files) I have now added two new 
types of files: 

- lat1Tower, lat2Tower, .....: Will always have the correct LAT grid positions
- singleBay1Tower: Will be a single tower in position 0.
